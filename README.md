Create a drum machine application in Using React. js.

Add a power button to turn drum on and off.
Add a slider to adjust volume and display volume.

Within #drum- machine I can see 9 clickable drum pad elements, each with a class
name of drum- pad, a unique id that describes the audio clip the drum pad will be set
up to trigger, and an inner text that corresponds to one of the following keys on the keyboard: Q, W, E, A, S, D, Z, X, C. The drum pads MUST be in this order.

When I press the trigger key associated with each. drum- pad, the audio clip contained in its child audio element should be triggered (e. g. pressing the Q key should trigger the drum pad which contains the string Q, pressing the W key should trigger the drum pad which contains the string W, etc. ).
play audio for

When a. drum- pad is triggered, a string describing the associated audio clip is displayed as the inner text of the #display element (each string must be unique).

All the .class and #id required are there in boilerplate, don't change them.
